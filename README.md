The script's task is to read text from the file artykul.txt and process it using the OpenAI API to make it ready for insertion between the <body> tags in an HTML file.

To achieve this, a prompt named prompt_merge was created within the script. Additionally, I created a file named szablon.html to serve as a template for displaying a sample article layout. Subsequently, I created a prompt that merges the processed text with the template and saves it to the file podglad.html.
